\title{Non-compensate Recommendation Models
}

\author{Anonymous

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The study of consumer psychology reveals two categories of procedures used by consumers to make consumption related choices: compensatory rules and non-compensatory rules. Existing models assume the consumers follow the compensatory rules, which are to make decisions based on a weighted or summated score over different aspects. In this paper, we present a novel model which adopts non-compensatory decision rules. An item is selected because  (1) it is superior on the most important aspect, and (2) its performance is beyond the minimally acceptable level on other aspects. Furthermore, we incorporate other psychological concepts such as evaluation process and ordinal utility to predict consumption in activity sessions. We experimentally demonstrate that this model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
%Recsys
\textbf{R}ecommender \textbf{S}ystem (RS) has received a lot of research attention. In the fruitful literature of RS, latent factor models are the most ubiquitous and successful  because of the simplicity to implement and their superior performance. Latent factor models represent users and items as vectors of factors with the same dimensions~\cite{Gopalan2015Scalable,Hu2008Collaborative}. Inner products of the latent factor vectors are used to reconstruct the observations, which could be either point-wise values (i.e. the ratings users give to items~\cite{}) or pair-wise rankings (i.e. the order of user feedbacks~\cite{}).


%Existing work: compensate
Intuitively, a user's factors in latent factor models encode the user's ``preferences'' on some hidden ``aspects'', while an item's factors convey information about the item's ``property'' on the same aspects. The inner product describes the summated score over all aspects that a user assigns to an item. From the perspective of users, the scoring of an item is based on compensatory rules, i.e. the shortcomings of an item are balanced out by its strongpoints.

Existing latent factor models in RS community are implementations of the compensatory decision rules. However, in the field of psychological science, ample evidence~\cite{Engel1986Consumer} exist to support that, despite of the compensatory rules, consumers often adopt non-compensatory rules. Non-compensatory rules do not allow a good performance on one aspect of an item to compensate for poor performances on other aspects. 



%Research problems
To the best of our knowledge, there is no RS model that is based on non-compensatory decision making rules.
In this work, we are motivated by psychological studies to build new RS models based on non-compensatory rules. We want to study the following three research questions. (1) How do we model the non-compensatory rules? (2) Do users follow the same rules for different feedbacks, i.e. explicit feedback and implicit feedback? (3) Can the model be scaled to massive recommender systems?
  
%challenge
Non-compensatory rules include lexicographic, conjunction and disjunction rules. Under lexicographic rules, products are compared on the most important aspect. Under conjunction and disjunction rules, the consumer imposes requirements for minimally acceptable values on each aspect separately. The conjunction and disjunction rules are often used in conjunction with lexicographic rules.
  
%For explicit feedback
Explicit feedback. graded implicit feedback.  

%For implicit feedback
Binary implicit feedback. 

%Algorithm
For the above two models, we propose 

%Contribution
Our contributions are three folds. (1) for explicit and graded sessional feedback. (2) for binary implicit feedback. (3) highly parrallel inference algorithm. 

%Paper structure
This paper is structured as follows. We briefly introduce related work in Sec.~\ref{sec:relatedwork}. The main contributions of this paper are described in Sec.~\ref{sec:model1} to Sec.~\ref{sec:algorithm}. The complete non-compensate model for explicit and graded sessional feedback is presented in Sec.~ref{sec:model1}. The simplified non-compensate model for binary implicit feedback is presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:model2}. The highly parrallel algorithm is presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:algorithm}. We analyze experimental results on real recommendation data sets in Sec.~\ref{sec:experiment}. Finally, we conclude our work and give future directions in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
